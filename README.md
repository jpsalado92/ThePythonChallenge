# Embracing the Challenge
In order to better showcase my python programming skills to potential recruiters I decided to embark ["The Python Challenge"](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).<br/>
This test consists on 33 levels of increasing difficulty in which  many Python modules and resources are fundamental.
Here is a detailed list of the levels I have solved so far and a small summary of the used methods:

Challenge | Contents  
:---: | -------------
[0](0)  | common sense
[1](1) | map(), list comprehensions
[2](2) | re, set(), requests
[3](3) | re.findall(), requests
[4](4) | re.sub(), requests

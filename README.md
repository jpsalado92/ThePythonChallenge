# Embracing the Challenge
In order to better showcase my python programming skills to potential recruiters I decided to embark ["The Python Challenge"](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).<br/>
This test consists on 33 levels of increasing difficulty in which  many Python modules and resources are fundamental.
Here is a detailed list of the levels I have solved so far and a small summary of the used methods:

Challenge | Contents  
:---: | -------------
[0](00)  | common sense
[1](01) | map(), list comprehensions
[2](02) | re, set(), requests
[3](03) | re
[4](04) | re
[5](05) | pickle
[6](06) | zipfile
[7](07) | PIL, numpy, decoding
[8](08) | bz2
[9](09) | matplotlib, requests.auth, re
[10](10) | look&say sequence (algorithm)

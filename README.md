In order to better showcase my python programming skills to potential recruiters I decided to embark ["The Python Challenge"](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).<br/>
This test consists on 33 levels of increasing difficulty in which  many Python modules and resources are fundamental.
Here is a detailed list of the levels I have solved so far and a small summary of the used methods:

Challenge | Contents  
:---: | -------------
[0](https://github.com/jpsalado92/ThePythonChallenge/tree/master/0)  | Arithmetic operations
[1](https://github.com/jpsalado92/ThePythonChallenge/tree/master/1) | map(), list comprehensions
[2](https://github.com/jpsalado92/ThePythonChallenge/tree/master/2) | re, set()
